# MATH189 Final Project
Final Project for MATH189 winter 2023, Data Analysis and Inference

In this project, we work on the SPAM E-mail Database [spambase.DOCUMENTATION](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mlearn/MLRepository.html) from the UCI ML repository, which contains 4601 observations of 57 continuous features and 1 categorical class label. We first process the data using log transformation, standardization, and discretization. We also visualize the data, and apply LR, LDA/QDA, Tree-based methods, and linear/non-linear SVM to train a predictive model that uses traits of the email to predict whether it is spam ([Rmd file]("https://github.com/YiyaoL/MATH189/blob/main/Full.rmd"). 

The results of the models are shown in the following table.
